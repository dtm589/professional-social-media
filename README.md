## User Story
As a User
I WANT to USE a ClikdOn application
BY Creating an account or Use existing one
So THAT I CAN create connections and follow  people in my area and career field

## Our Project Idea
It’s always nice to be surrounded with like-minded people. You definitely can found those individuals online, however, sometimes, they are on the other part of the country. We get our idea to create ClikdOn so we can find those people in your town/city. 
ClikdOn gives you the ability to see people who are on similar career path in your chosen location so you can start creating connections and built your profile.

## Project Successes
The biggest success, in our opinion, was sepparation of roles within the group, we all knew our responsibilities and deadlines for them. 
Another success, compare with last project, we didn’t have any merging conflicts, and overall git process was smooth and easy this time.

## Issues With This Project
The main challenge we had laid down in our initial idea of using npm Geolocator package, unfortunately on day 2 we made a decision to not proceed with the idea, the reason for it - it’s  because that package required some payment on our part. The other challenge that we faces couple of times is to link everything and make it work in sync.
